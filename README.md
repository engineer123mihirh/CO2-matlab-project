Detection and Visualization of CO2 Concentration Using Hyperspectral Satellite Data
Develop a CO2 detection algorithm using hyperspectral images and visualize the results geospatially.

Motivation
The detection and monitoring of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), are crucial for understanding and combating climate change. CO2 is a significant contributor to global warming, and its concentration in the atmosphere has been rising due to human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Monitoring CO2 levels helps scientists and policymakers make informed decisions to mitigate its impact. Companies and research institutions are investing in advanced technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging, to accurately detect and analyze CO2 concentrations. Hyperspectral data from satellites provides comprehensive spectral information that can be used to identify and quantify various gases in the atmosphere.

Project Description
Process satellite hyperspectral data to detect areas with high concentrations of CO2 and visualize this information on a world map using Hyperspectral Imaging Library for Image Processing Toolbox™ and the Mapping Toolbox™. Explore advanced techniques to detect CO2 concentration and/or different types of gases and visualize the results with geospatial information.

Suggested steps:

Data Acquisition: Download hyperspectral datasets from relevant sources such as Landsat (you can download a sample Landsat dataset from our server, as shown in this example, but for the complete dataset use the USGS EarthExplorer), or AVIRIS, or any other source of your choice.
Data Preprocessing: Load the hyperspectral data into MATLAB using the hypercube function. Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as noise reduction and Atmospheric Correction to convert radiance to reflectance.
CO2 Detection: Implement algorithms to detect CO2 concentration from hyperspectral data. Use spectral indices or other relevant methods to quantify CO2 levels. Techniques for estimating CO2 emission from hyperspectral images include:
Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF)
Clustering: Perform k-means clustering on the hyperspectral data to group pixels with similar spectral properties.
Matched Filter Design: For each cluster, design a matched filter tuned to the specific spectral signature of CO2.
Filter Application: Apply the matched filters to the hyperspectral data to detect CO2 anomalies.
Joint Reflectance and Gas Estimator (JRGE)
Initial Estimation: Use a smoothing spline estimator to obtain an initial estimate of surface reflectance.
Gas Density Estimation: Estimate gas densities based on the initial reflectance estimate
Iterative Refinement: Iteratively refine the estimates of reflectance and gas densities until convergence.
Spectral Fitting Algorithm
Radiative Transfer Model: Simulate spectra using a radiative transfer model that includes CO2 absorption features.
Spectral Matching: Match the observed spectra from the real data to the simulated spectra using spectral matching techniques.
CO2 Quantification: Quantify CO2 levels based on the best match between observed and simulated spectra.
Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR)
Absorption Feature Identification: Identify the specific absorption bands of CO2 in the hyperspectral data.
Continuum Interpolation: Perform continuum interpolation to estimate the depth of the CO2 absorption features.
Band Ratio Calculation: Calculate the band ratio for the CO2 absorption features.
CO2 Concentration Estimation: Estimate CO2 concentration based on the calculated band ratios.
Result Analysis: Analyze the final estimates to quantify CO2 concentrations and identify regions with elevated CO2 levels
Visualization: Visualize the detected CO2 concentration, including geospatial information, on a world map using the Mapping Toolbox (See this example) .
